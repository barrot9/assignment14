### Execution guide:

1. 'make' builds the project.
2.  run './assembler input_files/file1 input_files/file2 input_files/file3...' to assemble files. Make sure to put .as files in "input_files" dir.
3. 'make clean' cleans previously built object files.

This project comes with 5 built-in files. Execute "make test" to run the assembly with them.

### Output
- Upon successful assembly, all object, entry(if exists) and external(if exists) files will be located in the 'output_files' directory.
- Errors will be printed out in the terminal, screenshots for faulty files are in the screenshots directory.

### Final notes
This was a difficult project and the writing and debugging took us alot longer then we anticipated,
but still overall we had a fun and educational experience writing it. 

* Pleae note the we got an extension to the final date of submition untill the 01.09.24 because of miluim.
